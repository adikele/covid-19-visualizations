PROJECT PLAN:
Stage 1 (ready): Country plots for a fixed date 
Stage 2 (in the works): Country plots showing growth/decline of cases reported over a period 

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
Program displays Covid-19 data taking its source from a .csv file with worldwide figures. 
A bar graph showing the cumulative number of new virus infections per 100000 inhabitants 
is plotted for any user-entered country. 
The cumulative number is during the 14 days prior to the compilation date of the .csv file. 
The program also shows the data for four other countries, picked randomly, 
from the same continent as the user-entered country. 

SPECIFICATIONS:
1. This program uses python 3.7 and the following libraries: 
(i) matplotlib 3.3.0
(ii) pandas 1.1.0
2. Download the latest "COVID-19 cases worldwide" .csv file from 
https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data
and save it in some folder. 
Change code line 49 to provide the file path and name of your file. 

TESTS:
1. Tested for different countries by running program and manually checking ouput. 
(One bug found and corrected. Now tests run OK)
